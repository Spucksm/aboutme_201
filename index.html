          <div class="a"> 
          Welcome to all about me. In here you will find all the correct answers to my questions. 
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="b"> 
            Firstly, my name is Spenser Spuck. I was born in Tacoma, WA and was raised in Tacoma as well. I met my best friend at age 5 who lived just 3 houses down from where I lived at the time. It is quite funney really. He was walking his families pet goat in his front yard, on a leech of course, because laws exsist. I was riding my bike on the sidewalk and I saw him holding the leech to his goat and his goat was munching on the grass. I found this to be quite interesting so I stopped and introduced myself. I asked him how old he was and he said he was 5. Wow , just like me. I ask him when his birthday is and he tells me June 1st. No way same as me! what year were you born? he says 1989! holy cow, I have the same birthday! Come to realize him and I were born on the same day, of the same month, of the same year, in the same hospital, only live 3 houses away from each other, and we are going to go to the same school in the coming school year!

          <div class="c">

            After that day, we were inseperable up until high school. We lived between two different high schools so he went to one and I went to a different one. We still were best friends jsut didn't get to spend as much time together.

            After graduating high school in 2007 I joined the United States Marine Corps. My first MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) was Infantryman. I did 2 combat tours, first to Iraq and 2nd to Afghanistan. I fished my first contract in 2011 and left active duty to come back to the civilian world.

          <div class="e">

            I did some college, which i had a difficult time with and ended up dropping out and getting a full time job working security. I did really well and was promoted to Western Washington regional manager within 9 months. I did that for the next year and half but started to feel unfullfilled. I was missing the Marines.

            I contacted a prior service recuriter with the Marines and joined Reserves in 2014. I was in the Reserves from 2014 until just resently when I finished my contract in 2020. During muy time in the Reserves I went on my third combat deployment which was my second deploymnet to Afghanistan.
